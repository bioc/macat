Description: This library contains functions to investigate links
        between differential gene expression and the chromosomal
        localization of the genes. MACAT is motivated by the common
        observation of phenomena involving large chromosomal regions
        in tumor cells. MACAT is the implementation of a statistical
        approach for identifying significantly differentially expressed
        chromosome regions.
        The functions have been tested on a publicly available data
        set about acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Yeoh et al.Cancer Cell
        2002), which is provided in the library 'stjudem'.
