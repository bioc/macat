Description: This library contains functions to investigate links
        between differential gene expression and the chromosomal
        localization of the genes. MACAT is motivated by the common
        observation of phenomena involving large chromosomal regions
        in tumor cells. MACAT is the implementation of a statistical
        approach for identifying significantly differentially
        expressed chromosome regions. The functions have been tested
        on a publicly available data set about acute lymphoblastic
        leukemia (Yeoh et al.Cancer Cell 2002), which is provided in
        the library 'stjudem'.
