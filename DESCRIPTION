Description: This library contains functions to investigate links
        between differential gene expression and the chromosomal
        localization of the genes. MACAT is motivated by the common
        observation of chromosomal aberrations in tumor cells. The
        basic idea is to define tumor subtypes by characteristic
        patterns of aberrations. These patterns might be useful for
        classification of new tumor samples. The predictive power of
        patterns found can be evaluated by writing scores to text
        files, which can be used with Hidden-Markov-Models in Python.
        The functions have been tested on a publicly available data
        set about acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Yeoh et al.Cancer Cell
        2002), which is provided in the library 'stjudem'.
